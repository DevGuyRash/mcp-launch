# UI Inspiration (Pattern-Level Only)

This TUI borrows UX patterns (not code) from just‑every/code:

- Persistent header and footer with context-aware hints.
- Readable, single-column diff view with +/- markers.
- Strong-contrast theme tokens with a no-color fallback.
- Optional details panel concept (mapped here to a details section in Menu and a help overlay via `?`).
- Consistent keymap across views.
