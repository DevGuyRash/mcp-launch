Kickoff: Created spec requirements for TUI UX improvements focusing on Description status tags (Edited/Trimmed/Truncated/Over Limit/length counters), keys legend/help overlay with mode/status bar, diff viewer alignment/wrap/syntax highlighting fixes, editor mode clarity with wrap persistence, and consistent list behavior. Aligned with steering (Product consistency, Tech diff modes, NO_COLOR fallback). Awaiting approval in dashboard. Next phases: design, tasks after approval. Risks: terminal width handling edge cases, performance under long diffs, color fallbacks. Decisions: remove numeric shortcuts 1â€“4 from server options menu; adopt grouped multi-line key help; status bar shows mode + wrap state; wrap toggle works in both diff modes with horizontal scrolling when off; fall back to unified view on narrow terminals.
