Completed implementation for spec 'tui-preflight-ux' on branch 'tui'. Tasks 1â€“15 delivered: preflight aggregation with status/errs, TUI status badges and details, safe abort semantics, unified navigation, description editor + diff improvements, launch picker persistence, styled Results summary with copy block, help overlay and no-color fallback, panic hardening, and docs (MANUAL_TESTS.md, INSPIRATION.md). Build passes (go build ./...). To verify: run with --tui across sample configs; check Results and cancel semantics; confirm API key masking in summary and full key in copy block; NO_COLOR env triggers fallback. Next: optional UI polish and unit tests for TUI reducers and trim300.
